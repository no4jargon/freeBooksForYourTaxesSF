# SF Library Book Finder

This simple mobile-friendly webapp lets SF residents search for books and provides links to digital copies on Open Library. It also offers quick search links across other library services such as Libby/OverDrive, Boundless, enki, hoopla, UDN and SFPL's historical works on the Internet Archive.

## Usage

Open `index.html` in a web browser. Enter the title of a book and hit **Search**. The app will display up to five matches with links to their Open Library pages. Below the results is a list of links to search the same title on Libby/OverDrive, Boundless, enki, hoopla, UDN, and SFPL Historical Works.
